Description: Different approaches to censored regression with conditional heteroskedasticity are provided.
  First, continuous distributions can be used for the response (typically censored at zero) with separate
  linear predictors for the mean and variance. Second, cumulative link models for ordinal data (obtained by
  interval-censoring continuous data) can be employed for heteroskedastic extended logistic regression (HXLR).
  In the latter type of models, the intercepts depend on the thresholds that define the intervals.
