Changes in Version 0.9-0

  o Added vignette to introduce the crch() function with some
    theoretical background and an illustrating example:
    vignette("crch", package = "crch")

  o The crch() function now also supports truncated responses.
    Furthermore added a wrapper function trch() to fit truncated
    regression models.

  o crch(): Analytical gradients and Hessian matrices are provided for most 
    models to speed up maximum likelihood optimization
    (not available for student-t distribution with degrees of freedom
    estimation).  

  o crch(): For the scale model a link function can now be specified
    (log, identity, or quadratic). In previous version only the log
    was supported.

  o Added functions for probability density, cumulative distribution, 
    random numbers, and quantiles for censored and truncated normal, 
    logistic, and student-t distributions.

  o The residuals() method for crch objects now also provides quantile 
    residuals (Dunn and Smyth 1996).

  o Added update() method for crch objects.


Changes in Version 0.1-0

  o First official release of the package on CRAN. See citation("crch")
    for the accompanying manuscripts. Note that the interface of both
    crch() and hxlr() is still under development and might change in
    future versions of the package.
