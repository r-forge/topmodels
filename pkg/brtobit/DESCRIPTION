Description: Tobit models are regression models with a Gaussian response variable left-censored at zero, constant latent variance,
  and a latent mean that depends on covariates through a linear predictor. As an alternative to plain maximum likelihood estimation,
  the adjusted score equations of Kosmidis and Firth (2010) <doi:10.1214/10-ejs579> are utilized to obtain bias-reduced estimates of
  the model parameters.
