Description: Bias-reducted tobit regression models are provided.
  These are Gaussian regression models with a response variable left-censored at zero,
  constant latent variance, and a latent mean that depends on covariates
  through a linear predictor. Instead of estimating the parameters by plain maximum
  likelihood a bias-reduced estimator is employed.
