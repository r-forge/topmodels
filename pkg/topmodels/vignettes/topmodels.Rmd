## Overview

As a consequence of the growing importance of probabilistic predictions in
various application fields due to a necessary functional risk management and
strategy, there is an increasing demand for appropriate probabilistic model
evaluation. Besides proper probabilistic scores [@Gneiting+Raftery:2007], which
evaluate not only the expectation but the entire predictive distribution,
graphical assessment methods are particularly advantageous to diagnose possible
model misspecification problems.

Probabilistic predictions are often based on distributional regression models,
whereby the computation of predictive distributions, probabilities, and
quantiles is generally dependent on the *R* package being used. Therefore,
routines to graphically evaluate probabilistic models are not always available
and if so then only for specific types of models and distributions provided by
the corresponding package. An easy to use unified infrastructure to graphical
assess and compare different probabilistic model types does not yet exist.

The
[**topmodels**](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/topmodels/pkg/topmodels/)
packages is designed to provide such an unifiying infrastructure to gain predictions
of probabilities, densities, scores, and Hessian values for probabilistic
models. The unifying prediction method offers the user numerous
graphical evaluation tools, such as 
rootograms [@Kleiber+Zeileis:2016], PIT histograms, reliagrams (reliability diagrams), 
randomized quantile Q-Q plots [@Dunn+Smyth:1996],
and worm plots [@Buuren+Fredriks:2001]. 

To be able to use the object-oriented framework of
[**topmodels**](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/topmodels/pkg/topmodels/),
solely a `procast()` method must exist for the model class of interest.
Currently the package provides generic `procast` methods for the model classes
`lm`, `glm`, [`crch`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=crch) [@Messner+Mayr+Zeileis:2016], and [`disttree`](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/partykit/pkg/disttree/) [@Schlosser+Hothorn+Stauffer+Zeileis:2019].


## Installation

The package [**topmodels**](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/topmodels/pkg/topmodels/) is still in development and, therefore, the development version is hosted on R-Forge at <https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/topmodels/pkg/topmodels/> in a Subversion (SVN) repository and can be installed via

```{r installation-cran, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("topmodels", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
```

or via 

```{r installation-remotes, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_svn("svn://r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/topmodels/pkg/topmodels")
```

whereby a specific revision can be installed by employing the optional argument `revision`.


## Usage

For supported model classes, [**topmodels**](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/topmodels/pkg/topmodels/) provides various routines to easily
graphically assess and compare different probabilistic models and model types
using `ggplot2` [@Wickham:2016] and base *R* graphics:

```{r}
library("topmodels")
m <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
```

```{r}
rootogram(m)
```

```{r}
pithist(m)
```

```{r}
qqrplot(m)
```

```{r}
reliagram(m)
````

```{r}
wormplot(m)
```
