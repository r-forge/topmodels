\abstract{
    The demand of accurate and reliable probabilistic precipitation forecasts
    has seen an increase over the past decades, especially under the current
    changing climate which shows an increase in frequency and intensity of
    severe precipitation events.

    Probabilistic weather forecasts are typically generated by physically
    based numerical ensemble models providing multiple forecasts with slightly
    different conditions to depict the forecast uncertainty for a specific situation.
    Due to the nature of the data and the necessary simplifications these forecasts
    are not perfect and often show too little uncertainty, especially when compared
    to sprcific locations.

    Statistical post-processing is thus commonly used to increase the accuracy
    and reliability. Distributional regression models have shown to be compatible
    with other methods proposed over the past decade and allow to not only correct
    the expectation, but to simultanously adjust the uncertainty.
    Proper scoring rules, e.g., CPRS or log-scores, are often used to find the
    best performing model alongside with graphical assessment methods. The latter
    can be particularely useful to identify possible misspecifications in the
    model assumption and will be the focus of this contribution.

\section{Introduction/Background}

Forecasting precipitation has always been one of the essential quantities in
weather forecasting not only for the public, but for many socio-economic areas
like agriculture, power production, but also decison makers with respect risk
assessments. 
The demand of accurate predictions of the expected amount of precipitation has
increased over the past decade where severe precipitation events have increased
in intensity and frequency.

Weather forecasts are typically generated by physically based numerical weather
prediction models. To account for uncertainty, multiple forecasts are created
with slightly modified conditions which build an ensemble. This allows to not
only retrieve the expected amount of precipitation but information about the
uncertainty of a specific forecast.
Due to the nature of the data and the necessary  simplifications of the
numerical models compared to reality, these forecasts are not perfect and often
show too little uncertainty, especially when compared to specific locations.

Statistical post-processing allows to imrpove the accuracy and reliability
of these forecasts by comparing historical ensemble forecast and observed
amounts to correct for possible errors. In the recent past many different
statistical models have been proposed using different distributional assumptions
and learners. For evaluation, proper scoring rules are often used which not
only evaluate the expectation but the full probabilistic distribution of
the forecasts. To identify possible misspecifications in the model
assumption, graphical assessment methods are particularely advantageous
and will be presented in this article.

\section{Data}

Toy data set consisting of X days of accumulated 3-day precipitation
forecasts for station Innsbruck and corresponding observations.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Statistical models}

\subsection{Model assessment}

$$
y_i \sim \mathcal{D}(\theta_i | X_i)
$$

Rootogram (Marginal scale):

$$
\text{obs}_j = \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i I(y_i \in (b_j, b_{j+1}))
$$

$$
\text{exp}_j = \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i \big[ F(b_{j+1} | \hat{\theta}_i) - F(b_{j} | \hat{\theta}_i) \big],
$$

PIT residuals; CDF evaluated at observation $y_i$ given the
estimated parameters $\hat{\theta}_i$.

$$
u_i = F(y_i | \hat{\theta}_i)
$$


QQ-residuals

$$
\hat{r}_i = \Phi^{-1}\big(F(y_i | \hat{\theta}_i)\big) = \Phi^{-1}(u_i)
$$

for the theoretical quantiles ($z_i$) one typically draws $N$ equidistant
quantiles from the Normal distribution ($\frac{1}{N+1}, ..., \frac{N}{N+1}$),
plotting all pairs $\big((z_{(1)},\hat{r}_{(1)}), ..., (z_{(N)},\hat{r}_{(N)})\big)$

Wormplots: basically the same but detrended

$\big((z_{(1)},\hat{r}_{(1)} - z_{(1)}), ..., (z_{(N)},\hat{r}_{(N)} - z_{(N)})\big)$

\section{Model comparison}

Show plots here, refer to the equations above.
