Description: Unified infrastructure for probabilistic models and distributional regressions:
             Probabilistic forecasting of in-sample and out-of-sample of probabilities,
             densities, quantiles, and moments. Probabilistic scoring via log-score (log-likelihood),
             (continuous) ranked probability score, etc. Diagnostic graphics like rootograms, PIT histograms,
	     (randomized) quantile residual Q-Q plots, and reliagrams (reliability diagrams).
