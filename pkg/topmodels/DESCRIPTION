Description: Unified infrastructure for probabilistic models and distributional regressions:
             Probabilistic forecasting (procasting for short) in sample and out of sample of probabilities,
             densities, quantiles, and moments. Diagnostic graphics like rootograms, PIT histograms,
	     (randomized) quantile residual Q-Q plots, and reliagrams (reliability diagrams).
