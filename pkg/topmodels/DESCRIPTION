Description: Unified infrastructure for probabilistic models and distributional regressions:
             Computations of probabilities, densities, scores, and Hessians.
	     Probabilistic forecasting. Diagnostic graphics like rootograms, PIT histograms,
	     reliagrams (reliability diagrams), (randomized) quantile residual Q-Q plots.
